## Getting Started

### System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) or later, Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 or later, CentOS 7 or later). These are general guidelines; VISION should run on any system where Python is supported.
- **Python Version**: Python 3.6 or newer. It's essential to have a compatible Python version for the software's dependencies.
- **Memory (RAM)**: A minimum of 4 GB RAM, although 8 GB or more is recommended for processing large images or datasets.
- **Processor**: Intel Core i5 or equivalent, with at least 2 GHz processing speed. More advanced processors (i7, i9, or equivalent) can significantly improve performance, especially for computationally intensive tasks.
- **Hard Disk Space**: At least 1.5 GB of free space for installation, with additional space required for storing image data and analysis results.

### Note to Users
These requirements are provided as a general guideline based on typical software dependencies and the performance needs of image analysis tasks. Users with specific or advanced usage scenarios (e.g., handling very large datasets, 3D imaging, time-lapse analyses) might require more powerful hardware. We encourage users to consider their particular needs and consult with their IT department or professionals when setting up systems for VISION. Additionally, future versions of the software or updates to dependencies may alter these requirements.

### Testing Disclaimer
Please note that these system requirements are based on general expectations for software of this nature and have not been rigorously tested across all platforms. Performance can vary based on the specific hardware and software environment, size and complexity of the data being processed, and specific tasks being performed. We welcome feedback from our user community to help refine these recommendations over time.

### Installation Instructions
VISION is designed to be easily accessible, offering both a standalone version for a straightforward installation across Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as a Python-based version for advanced users or developers. Below are the steps to get started with either version.

#### Standalone Version Installation
**General Steps for All Platforms:**
1. Download the ZIP file for your respective operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) from the VISION official website.
2. Extract the ZIP file to your desired location. This will create a folder containing the VISION executable and all necessary dependencies.

**Windows:**
- Navigate to the extracted folder and double-click on `VISION.exe` to start the application.

**macOS:**
- Open the extracted folder, find the `VISION.app` file, and double-click to launch it. If you encounter any security prompts preventing the app from opening (due to macOS Gatekeeper), right-click (or Control-click) the app and select Open, then confirm in the dialog that you want to open it.

**Linux:**
- Open a terminal and change to the directory containing the extracted files.
- Make the VISION binary executable with the command: `chmod +x VISION` (replace `VISION` with the actual name of the binary file).
- Run the application by typing `./VISION` in the terminal.

#### Python-Based Version Setup
For those who prefer the flexibility of a Python environment or wish to integrate VISION into their existing workflows, follow these general steps:
1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: VISION requires Python 3.6 or newer. If you don't have Python installed, download it from [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Install Dependencies**: Some Python packages are required to run VISION. Install them using pip by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal or command prompt, assuming a `requirements.txt` file is provided with the necessary package names.
3. **Download and Run VISION**: Download the VISION Python scripts and run them in your preferred Python environment or IDE.

**Additional Resources:**
- Python Official Documentation: [https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html)
- pip Documentation: [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/)
- IDE Recommendations: Consider using an IDE such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, Spyder, or Jupyter Notebooks for a more integrated development experience.

**Note**
The standalone version simplifies the installation process by bundling the application with all its dependencies. It's ideal for users who prefer a quick setup without the need to manually install Python or additional packages. For detailed guides on using Python and managing packages, refer to the provided additional resources.
